## About The Project

There are many great Weather applications , however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a cool application so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

 
A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
